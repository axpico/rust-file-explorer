# rust-file-explorer

A lightweight and interactive command-line file explorer built in Rust. This tool allows users to navigate directories, view files, and perform basic file operations with an intuitive interface inspired by modern CLI tools.

## Features

- **Directory Navigation**: Change directories using the `cd` command.
- **File Listing**: View the contents of the current directory with color-coded output (directories in blue, files in yellow).
- **File Operations**:
  - Create new files with `create `.
  - Delete files or directories with `delete `.
  - Open files with the default application using `open `.
- **Interactive Interface**:
  - Command prompt shows the current directory.
  - User-friendly error and success messages.
  - Color-coded output for better readability.
- **Help Menu**: Type `help` to see all available commands.
